# Todo App

## :hear_no_evil: Overview

Since, learning React, I figured it would be good to start putting some of the newly acquired knowledge into good use. This is my first React Project, which utilised key aspects of React such as:

- Create-React-App
- Hooks
- Inline CSS
- Component structure
- Destructuring

## Minimalistic Todo App

> I created a Todo App that can help users complete daily tasks. By integrating a calender feature the app allows users to visualise and manage tasks on a daily basis.

## Running the app

Clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JoshHaokip/todo-list-react.git
```

Install all dependancies:

```
$ npm install
```

Start the server:

```
$ npm start
```

And open the app in your browser at <http://localhost:3000/>.
