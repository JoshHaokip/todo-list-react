### :hear_no_evil: Overview

Since, learning React, I figured it would be good to start putting some of the newly acquired knowledge into good use. This is my first React Project, which utilised key aspects of React such as:

- Create-React-App
- Hooks
- Inline CSS
- Component structure
- Destructuring
